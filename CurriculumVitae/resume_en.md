- For **changeMe years** I have been acquiring an advanced level in **Linux and scripts ( Bash and python )** and training as a Senior programmer, with extensive knowledge of **PHP, SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL**.
- My passion for new programming languages and technologies and my ability to adapt to changes and learn quickly have prompted me to venture into the world of **JavaScript (Node.js, deno.js, MongoDB, React, AngularJS, among others)** since 2017.
- In addition to carrying out the *complete life cycle of a project* (design, development, software integration and renovation), I can take care of both software and hardware maintenance.
